Iâ€™m @imbstack, I like building tools. Sometimes those tools are used to build other tools. This makes me happy.

I spent the last year in Port Townsend [learning how to build wooden boats](https://nwswb.canto.com/v/TrollerConstruction/album/PF9A4?from_main_library&display=curatedView&viewIndex=0). Now I'm back to the world of building imaginary things inside computers!
